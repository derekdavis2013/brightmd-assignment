Readme
======
This application was made with `create-react-app` as a starting template.


Technologies Used
-----------------
- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)


Running the application
-----------------------
Install dependencies

`npm install` or `yarn`


Start the application

`npm run start` or `yarn start`

Open browser and navigate to:

`localhost:3000`


Prompt #1
---------
I tried to adhere to the 4hr time limit, and because of that, I did not complete the 'Branding' portion of the application.
I believe the 'Hours of Operation' should behave correctly. Given more time,
I would complete the Branding section of the application as well clean up general looks. I chose to use Bootstrap components to speed up development and styling given the time limit.

Prompt #2
---------
If I were to deploy this application, I would want to do a few things. Aside from completing full functionality, I would first want to write atomated tests to ensure proper the application is working correctly. I would also want to remove a lot of extra code that `create-react-app` has added. Removing unused code would decrease the size of the application and improve load times. Finally, I would move bootstrap styles behind a CND that I controlled. Requesting styles from a CDN outside of my control introduces the possibilties of the data being moved or changed unexpectedly.
